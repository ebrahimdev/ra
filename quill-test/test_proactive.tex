\section{Introduction}

This is a test document to demonstrate the proactive citation suggestions feature. When you type sentences like this one, the extension should automatically suggest relevant citations based on the content. The system will analyze the text and look for papers that might be relevant to what you're writing.

\section{Background}

Large language models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data and can generate human-like responses to various prompts. The development of transformer architectures has been particularly influential in this area.

\section{Methodology}

Our approach involves using a combination of traditional machine learning techniques and modern deep learning methods. We employ a multi-stage pipeline that first preprocesses the input data, then applies various feature extraction methods, and finally uses a neural network for classification.
